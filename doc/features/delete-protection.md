# Delete Protection

One of the reason Hello HTTP was made is mis-clicking delete buttons is too easy. Protection must be made around it.

To delete anything in Hello HTTP, first click on the delete button, then wait for the "⚠︎" button to appear, then click
on it to confirm deletion.

## Recovery

Human mistakes can never be avoided completely. In case anything is deleted accidentally, it can be recovered from
[automatic backups](automatic-backup).
