# Hello HTTP

This is a cross-platform desktop application for testing HTTP APIs. This is an alternative to Postman, Insomnia REST, etc.

This was made because of the decision these software made to go cloud and some of their imperfects.

Though this was built to address my daily needs, hope this could also help solving many of your problems!
There is no plan to go a shared cloud, but it might be possible at a later stage to go online under clouds managed by
users themselves, for example, users' Dropbox, users' S3, or users' Git repository. That is a bit far at this
moment.
